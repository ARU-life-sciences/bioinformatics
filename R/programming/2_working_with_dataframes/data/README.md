## Barley

Total yield in bushels per acre for 10 varieties at 6 sites in each of two years. 
It is a data frame with 120 observations on the following 4 variables:

yield

    Yield (averaged across three blocks) in bushels/acre.
variety

    Factor with levels "Svansota", "No. 462", "Manchuria", "No. 475", "Velvet", "Peatland", "Glabron", "No. 457", "Wisconsin No. 38", "Trebi".
year

    Factor with levels 1932, 1931
site

    Factor with 6 levels: "Grand Rapids", "Duluth", "University Farm", "Morris", "Crookston", "Waseca"

Details

These data are yields in bushels per acre, of 10 varieties of barley grown in 
1/40 acre plots at University Farm, St. Paul, and at the five branch experiment 
stations located at Waseca, Morris, Crookston, Grand Rapids, and Duluth 
(all in Minnesota). The varieties were grown in three randomized blocks at each 
of the six stations during 1931 and 1932, different land being used each year of 
the test.

Immer et al. (1934) present the data for each Year*Site*Variety*Block. The data 
here is the average yield across the three blocks.

Immer et al. (1934) refer (once) to the experiment as being conducted in 1930 and 
1931, then later refer to it (repeatedly) as being conducted in 1931 and 1932. 
Later authors have continued the confusion.

Cleveland (1993) suggests that the data for the Morris site may have had the 
years switched.
