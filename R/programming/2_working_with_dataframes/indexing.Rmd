# Indexing data

What is indexing? In programming lingo it is the process of getting particular
values out of the data. For example, we want to get the 5th row of our data frame.
Or all the rows between 5 and 20. Or the third column. This may not be particularly
useful by itself, but we can index using the results from expressions.

## Indexing rows

How do I get the 5th row?

```{r}
# let's get barley back
# we can automatically convert strings to factors if we ask R to...
# which is what we did by hand in `reading_and_viewing.Rmd`
barley <- read.csv(file = "data/barley.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# get the 5th row
barley[5,]

```
Even though that's a short amount of code, there is a bit to break down.
