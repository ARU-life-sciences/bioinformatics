1. Create your own file systems using the in built commands, `mkdir`, `touch`
2. Modify your file system by renaming files, moving them, and copying them using
  the commands: `cp`, `mv`
3. Delete parts of your file system using `rm`

= Introduction

The file system is the layout of where all your files live in your computer. I have
a made up file system (@filesystem) which includes a root directory and a home
directory. The root is denoted in the filesystem as `/`, and usually has no files
or directories above it. The home directory is usually denoted as `~`, is further
in to your file system, and is where all of your familiar directories and files should
live (Documents, Pictures, Downloads, etc).

We were able to explore this file system using the `cd` and `ls` commands before. This is useful
for exploring. But we have a powerful toolkit for creating, moving, renaming, and destroying
files and directories too. The commands we will look look at are `mkdir` for making directories,
`touch` for creating files, `cp` for copying files or directories, `mv` for moving files or
directories, and `rm` for removing files or directories.

= Making the file system

First we will make a directory. For this, it does not matter where you are in the file system,
we will clean it up later.

#shell(
  ```bash
  # make the new directory
  mkdir new_directory
  # prove you made it
  cd new_directory
  # you should now be in your new directory
  ```,
  [Making directories using `mkdir` and going in to the directory you just made using `cd`.],
)

Make files using `touch`. `touch` is not the only way to create files, but it's a convenient one. There
are other ways to make files which we will explore later.

#shell(
  ```bash
  # You can create any file. I advise creating text based files
  #Â (i.e. not binary files), so they can be manipulated further later.
  touch file.txt
  # check you made the file
  ls -l
  ```,
  [Creating a file using `touch` and checking it's there using `ls`.],
)

This file is empty, so it is not very helpful at the moment. There are a couple of things we can
illustrate using this example though. What if we wanted to make a copy of this file? We use the
command `cp` to copy files or directories.

#shell(
  ```bash
  # copying files is called like this:
  # cp <file> <copied file location>
  cp file.txt file_copy.txt
  # check you made the file
  ls -l
  # make another directory
  mkdir copies
  # and copy a file into it
  cp file.txt ./copies/file_copy.txt
  ```,
  [Copying a file using `cp` and checking it's there using `ls`. We then copy another file
    into a subdirectory `copies`.],
)

Lastly, we can move files around. `mv` is also used frequently for renaming files. We should now
be in a directory called `new_directory` and there should be two files inside, `file.txt` and
`file_copy.txt`, with a directory called `copies` with `file_copy.txt` inside. We made a whole
file system in a couple of lines of code!

We can rename files easily.

#shell(
  ```bash
  mv file.txt wow.txt
  ```,
  [Renaming a file from `file.txt` to `wow.txt`],
)

And move them around just as easily.

#shell(
  ```bash
  # Moving a file from the `copies` directory
  # into the current one
  mv copies/file_copy.txt file.txt
  ```,
  [`mv` can move and rename files at the same time.],
)

We should have ended up with `wow.txt` and `file.txt` in the `new_directory` directory. There should
be nothing in the `copies` directory.

= Destroying the file system

Destroy files with `rm`. Destroy directories with `rm -r` (`-r` is recursive).
#text(red, weight: "extrabold")[Use `rm` with extreme caution]. Once you delete a file or directory
#text(red, weight: "extrabold")[it is gone forever]. There is no bin or trash with this command.


#shell(
  ```bash
  # delete everything we made
  # delete the copies directory
  rm -r copies

  # delete the files in this current directory
  # rm can take multiple arguments
  rm file.txt wow.txt

  # go up
  cd ..
  # and remove our directory
  rm -r new_directory
  ```,
  [Destroying our little file system.],
)

And with that, we removed everything!
