    <h1><code class="language-bash">git</code> and GitHub</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>Two very important technologies for modern software development. For students and academics, these are invaluable
      tools to catalogue and develop your code. Many branches of academia which rely on software, like bioinformatics,
      use git to version control their software, and GitHub to make it available to a wide audience. This is important
      so other people can see what you are working on, and can lead to collaborations in longer term. In addition, many
      journals require source code to be published, and if they don't require it, it's a good idea to do so anyway for
      reproducibility. The link at the top right of this page will take you to the home of this website, which is
      version controlled using <code class="language-bash">git</code> and published to the world using GitHub.
    </p>

    <p> As with many things, learning basic <code class="language-bash">git</code> is quite easy, but <a
        href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">things get tough very
        quickly</a>. Stick with it!</p>

    </ul>


    <div id="install">
      <h2>Installing <code class="language-bash">git</code> and joining GitHub</h2>
      <p>Depending on which machine you have (Windows, Mac, Linux), you can follow the instructions on the <a
          href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">official <code
            class="language-bash">git</code> website</a> to
        install it. Once installed, open up terminal on a Mac or Linux, or powershell on Windows, and type:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">git --version</code></pre>

      <p>On Windows machines, I'd recommend installing WSL (<a
          href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>), which should
        have
        <code class="language-bash">git</code> installed on it already. Failing that, <code
          class="language-bash">git</code> BASH is a good alternative. Install
        that <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">here</a>. Provided that you are not crippled by the security system of
        your computer, this should be relatively easy to do.
      </p>

      <p>Once you have installed
        <code class="language-bash">git</code>, we can look at GitHub. You can sign up for a free account on the <a
          href="https://github.com/">GitHub website</a>. It should be very self-explanatory to sign up.
        If you are part of ARU, please <a href="https://github.com/ARU-life-sciences">join the Life Sciences GitHub</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="explore">
      <h2>Explore a repository</h2>
      <p>Once you have signed up for GitHub, you can explore some repositories. I recommend looking at the <a
          href="https://github.com/ARU-life-sciences/bioinformatics">Bioinformatics repository</a> on the
        ARU-life-sciences GitHub. You can see all the files and folders.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="create">
      <h2>Creating a new repository</h2>
      <p>There are two ways to create a new repository. You can create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your
        local machine, or you can create a new repository on your local machine and push it to GitHub. I recommend the
        latter, as I think it's easier to do.</p>

      <p>You firstly need to create a directory/folder on your machine. In terminal or powershell, navigate to the
        directory and type:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">git init</code></pre>
      <p>This will create a new <code class="language-bash">git</code> repository in your current directory. This is a
        <mark>local repository</mark>.
        Now you can add, modify, or delete files in the directory and they can be tracked. These files
        are not tracked by default - we have to do the work.
      </p>

      <p>Now go over to GitHub and create a new repository. It will ask for some details, so fill those in. Once you
        click 'create repository', there will be some commands you can run to link your repository you made on your
        computer just now, to the remote one.</p>

      <p>The code will be something like the following:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main</code></pre>

      <p><code class="language-bash">git remote add origin</code> tells your computer where the remote repository is
        (i.e. on GitHub). After running this, the lcoal repository is linked to the remote one.
        <code class="language-bash">git branch -M main</code> renames the default branch from <code
          class="language-bash">master</code> to <code class="language-bash">main</code>.
        We will consider branches much later, but for now think of them as copies of the repository under different
        names.
        <code class="language-bash">git push -u origin main</code> pushes the local repository to the remote
        one. If you run this command, it <mark>will fail</mark> as there's nothing in our repository!
        But don't worry, we will fix this in a moment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="basic">
      <h2>Basic idea</h2>
      <p>We have made a blank repository, and we want to put something in it. We can create a file in the
        directory. Do this any way you want. Here's a way I'd do it on a Unix like machine:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">echo "Hello, world!" &gt; hello.txt</code></pre>

      <p>Now we have a simple text file with the text "Hello, world!" in it. We can add this file to the
        "local stage" using:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">git add hello.txt</code></pre>

      <p>This adds the file to the local stage, which is like a waiting area. We can add more files to the
        stage if we want to. A core idea in <code class="language-bash">git</code> is that we make incremental changes
        to our
        repository which we can easily reason with. Adding a file to the stage is necessary, but doesn't
        actually do anything by itself. We need to commit these changes. Commiting changes adds the change
        to our local log file. Let's do it:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m "Add hello.txt"</code></pre>

      <p>The <code class="language-bash">-m</code> flag is for "message". The message is a short description
        of the change we made, and is <mark>necessary</mark>. Please make your commit messages informative and
        descriptive if you can.
      </p>

      <p>We have added and commited our changes to the local repository. Check the message log using
        <code class="language-bash">git log</code>. You should see the message you just made.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">git log</code></pre>

      <p>We can now push these changes to the remote repository (i.e. GitHub) using:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">git push -u origin main</code></pre>

      <p>The changes are now on GitHub! You can check by refreshing the page.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="readme">
      <h2>Adding a README</h2>
      <p>It's good practice to add a <code class="language-bash">README</code> file to your repository.
        This file can contain information about the repository, such as what it's for, who made it, and how to
        use it. This file will be displayed on the repository page on GitHub. We will switch gear and add
        it from the website.</p>

      <p>If you navigate to your repository on the GitHub website, you can click the "Add a README" button.
        This will bring up a text editor which you can use to write your
        <code class="language-bash">README</code>. Put something in there and save it. Notice how you will have
        to commit the changes just like we did before. You can add an extra description if you wish. After
        you are done, commit the changes.
      </p>

      <p>Now we have our changes committed to the remote (on GitHub), but they are not on our local machine.
        We can pull them in using:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">git pull</code></pre>

      <p>The changes should now be merged with your local repository. You can check using:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-bash">git log</code></pre>

      <p>It should show that you now have two commits.</p>

      <p>And that's it! You are now a <code class="language-bash">git</code> and GitHub user. This was
        a very simple introduction to version control. We will look at multi-user collaboration, branches,
        and pull requests in a separate tutorial. Good luck!</p>
